1st Commit - Added all challenge files and folder + Comments on what to work on. 
2nd Commit - Added variables to represent Alphabet and converted strings to Upper and Lower Case.
3rd/4th Commit - Finally got Working variables for Alphanumerics + Special Chars. Converted Numbers,Letters Special Characters into arrays
5th/6th commit - Created Iterator for password length, converted it into variables for minimum and maximum. Polished off the prompt boxes so the trigger works and it properly asks for password length. Added a functioning script that displays the array in an alert window. This will eventually display the final product.
7th Commit - Built the structure to prompt the user to incoporate different options into the password. It currently cycles all options, displaying a password of correct length.
